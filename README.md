# Survival Fables - Readme

## Welcome to Survival Fables!

In this thrilling text-based adventure game, you and your friends embark on an epic journey to survive in a world filled with dangerous aliens. Work together to build a base, craft powerful gear, and fight off relentless alien attacks. But beware, for the aliens are growing stronger, and the fate of your team lies in your hands!

## Getting Started

1. Launch the game, and let the game tell you short story!
2. Input the number of players and have each player choose a unique name for their character.

## Beginnings

Once you've set up the game, you'll be presented with a list of options for your character to explore. The world is yours to discover, and you can fight aliens, explore for valuable materials, and start building your base!

## Gathering Materials

Venture out to explore the world and gather essential materials. Be prepared for surprises, as the amount of materials you find is randomized. Sometimes you'll strike gold, and other times, you may come back empty-handed.

## Alien Threats

With each exploration, one basic alien will spawn. As you gather more materials, the aliens will grow stronger and merge into more formidable foes. Keep a close eye on them, as they may attack your base at random intervals.

## Building Your Base

Construct vital buildings to enhance your chances of survival:

5. **Armour:** Add protection to your character with armor. Craft it using 20 stone and 30 iron.

## Healing and Reviving

With an Infirmary in place, you can tend to your team's well-being:

1. **Heal:** For 15 medicine, you can restore 20 health points to your character.
